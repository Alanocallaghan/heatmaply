heatmaply 0.1.0 (2016-05-14)
==============================

TODO:
==============================
* fix side labels
* add bars for extra categories
* remove hover information from dendrograms
* remove unneeded code from d3heatmap
* fix docs!
* add many options for controlling the heatmap "as it should be"
* check if I can control the ylim of the dendrograms and if that would resolve the extra space I see by default.
* add to the docs:

library(heatmaply)
library(magrittr)
library(plotly)
heatmaply(mtcars, k_row = 3, k_col = 2) %>% layout(margin = list(l = 130, b = 40))

* create a vignette with examples

* implement all relevant options streight to heatmaply.

* release to CRAN

* write a post!
