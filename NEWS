heatmaply 0.3.0 (2016-05-25)
==============================

### NEW FEATURES
* heatmaply
  * Now works with Rowv=F and Colv=F (by introducing a new un-exported function: heatmap_subplot_from_ggplotly)
  * remove space between the heatmap and dendrograms (via: coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE)  and coord_flip(expand = FALSE))
  * added the margin parameter (to control the distance between the heatmap and the dendrograms.)

### BUG FIXES
* fix #2 : Error: Don't know how to add scale_fill_gradient_fun to a plot
  by moving "scale_fill_gradient_fun" after "..." (I may change this parameter's name later)


### VIGNETTE
* heatmaply now has a basic vignette.


heatmaply 0.2.1 (2016-05-23)
==============================

### BUG FIXES
* fix various import issues that caused warnings with devtools::check()


heatmaply 0.2.0 (2016-05-23)
==============================
### NEW FEATURES
* More control over colors in heatmaply via the new parameters: colours, limits, na.value, and scale_colour_gradient_fun.
* first attempts at row_dend_left (although this is not yet working.)

### BUG FIXES
* dendrograms are now presented without axes text.
* passing scale (= "row" or "column") works again.


heatmaply 0.1.0 (2016-05-14)
==============================

* First (very rough) version. It has a minimal working example, as well as MANY things to fix/tweak/adjust.




TODO:
==============================
* add bars for extra categories
* remove hover information from dendrograms
* remove unneeded code from d3heatmap
* fix docs!
* add many options for controlling the heatmap "as it should be"
* check if I can control the ylim of the dendrograms and if that would resolve the extra space I see by default.

* implement all relevant options streight to heatmaply.

* release to CRAN

* write a post!
